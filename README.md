# Neural-Machine-Translation
Project based on Natural Language Processing focuses on the deep  learning-based model that translate the text from one language to another language. Using sequence to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with encoder-decoder architecture. It involves preprocessing and  training model to learn linguistic patterns using framework keras.
